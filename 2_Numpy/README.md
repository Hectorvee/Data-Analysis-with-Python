# NumPy

Welcome to the NumPy section of the Data Analysis with Python repository!

## Overview

This section contains resources and video courses focused on the NumPy library. NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.

## What You Will Learn

- **Basics of NumPy**: Understand the core functionality of NumPy, including array creation and manipulation.
- **Comparison with Built-in Lists**: Learn how NumPy arrays differ from Python's built-in lists.
- **Indexing and Reshaping**: Master how to index, slice, and reshape arrays to suit your needs.
- **Applied Statistics**: Use NumPy for statistical operations and mathematical computations.

## Resources

- **Video Course**: Learn from Keith Galli's comprehensive video course covering NumPy basics and advanced techniques.
- **Tutorials**: Access detailed tutorials and practical examples to solidify your understanding of NumPy.

## Getting Started

1. **Install NumPy**: If you haven't already, you can install NumPy using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
