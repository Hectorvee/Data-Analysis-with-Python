# Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to the **Data Analysis with Python** repository. This repository is designed to guide you through the process of mastering data analysis using Python, from the basics to more advanced concepts, with a focus on practical application through projects.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into three main sections:

### 1. [Data Analysis with Python](./Data_Analysis_with_Python/)
Dive deep into the entire process of data analysis with Python. This section includes comprehensive video courses created by Santiago Basulto that will teach you how to:
- Read data from various sources like CSV, SQL, and Excel.
- Process and clean data using powerful libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Additionally, you'll find a detailed course on Jupyter Notebooks to help you manage and run your Python code efficiently. A quick Python reference guide is also included to refresh your programming skills.

### 2. [NumPy](./Numpy/)
Learn the fundamentals of NumPy, a core library for numerical computing in Python. This section features a video course by Keith Galli that covers:
- The basics of NumPy and how it compares to Python's built-in lists.
- Writing code with NumPy, including indexing, reshaping, and performing applied statistics.
- Various techniques and functions that are essential for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

### 3. [Data Analysis with Python Projects](./Data_Analysis_with_Python_Projects/)
Apply your knowledge by working on real-world projects that involve data analysis using Python. This section is designed to help you:
- Demonstrate your understanding of key concepts in data analysis.
- Develop practical experience by working on diverse data analysis projects.
- Showcase your ability to handle various data sources and apply different analytical techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-with-python.git
cd data-analysis-with-python
```

Each section contains its own set of instructions, code examples, and resources to guide you through the learning process. We recommend starting with the **Data Analysis with Python** section to build a strong foundation before moving on to the NumPy course and finally testing your skills with the projects.
